# <b>RECIPE FINDER APP</b>

This is a recipe app that lets users search for recipes for a food. This app successfully uses the mealdb api to display each recipe in card view. 

  •	Users can see the where the recipe is from (nationality) and the instructions for the recipe. 
  •	Users also have access to the source of the recipe and a YouTube video cooking the meal, if available.
  •	Another cool feature is that users can add their own recipes and have it saved to the app.
